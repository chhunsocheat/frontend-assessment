Introduction
---
This exercise was implemented using React.js and React Bootstrap, and React-router-dom.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Exercise 1
---
To go to exercise one all you need to do is npm run start and the default endpoint will let you see my implementation of exercise 1.
The layout is reponsive using a mixture of flexbox and grid
Exercise 2
---
For exercise 2 you need to go to "/exercise2" endpoint to see the tabs and accordians. The tabs will show if the width of the screen is 1224px, and the accordians will show when the screen size if less than 1224px.

###### Bonus points

* Explain why the result of `('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase()` is `banana`.

This turns to `banana` because when nothing is plus with `a`, it will resolve to NaN because of a concept in javascript called type coersion. 
Now, if you add NaN to "ba" you will get "baNaN" again because of type coersion. If we add the letter `a` to the `baNaN`, it will be `baNaNa`. Finally, `toLowerCase()` will convert this to `banana`.
